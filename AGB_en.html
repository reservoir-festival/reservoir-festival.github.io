                    <p> </p>
                    <p>Because your order includes goods that are subject to age restrictions on sale, we ensure that
                        the orderer has reached the minimum age required by using a reliable process that includes
                        personal identity and<br />
                        age verification. The deliverer hands over the goods only after an age check and only to the
                        customer personally.
